					</ul>
					<p>
						The okapi, sometimes known as the <strong>forest giraffe <sup>2</sup></strong>, resembles a mix between a deer and a zebra and dwells among lush plants. It is, however, the giraffe‚Äôs only living relative. 

						The okapi is only found in the wild in the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and it possesses thick, oily fur that helps it stay dry in the rain. It also contains scent glands on the bottoms of its hooves, which aid in marking its territory. 

						The okapi‚Äôs small horns are covered in skin save for the tips. Unlike males, most females have knobby bumps instead of horns.

					</ul>
					<p>
						These adorable, <strong>fluffy bunnies <sup>3</sup></strong> are among the hairiest wild and domestic rabbit breeds. The origins of these rabbits can be traced back to Turkey. 

						Angora rabbits are grown for their long, velvety wool; they are also regarded as excellent pets.
